Transforming Pharmaceutical Inventory Management with Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning

This project addresses critical challenges in Sri Lanka’s pharmaceutical supply chain—such as stock-outs, overstocking, and inefficient procurement—by leveraging machine learning and predictive analytics. It includes the application of unsupervised (K-Means clustering) and supervised (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) learning techniques to analyze and optimize medicine inventory using real-world and publicly available datasets. The final output is a Streamlit-based AI dashboard that provides intuitive insights for pharmacists, inventory managers, and policymakers to improve supply chain efficiency, reduce wastage, and enhance medication availability.

Key features:

Exploratory data analysis & preprocessing pipelines

Clustering model to detect overstocking patterns

Classification models to predict expiry and stock-out risks

Model performance evaluation using key metrics

Interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time decision support

Focused on the Sri Lankan pharmaceutical industry context
